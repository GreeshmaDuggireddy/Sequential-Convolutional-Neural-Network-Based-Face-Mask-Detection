# Sequential-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Based-Face-Mask-Detection
A robust and scalable CNN prototype for COVID-19 face mask detection.

## Objective

Many doctors and scientists have suggested the
continued use of a face mask even after the availability
of the vaccine. Open public spaces cannot be monitored
but enclosed public spaces can be monitored. The
passageway of these public spaces should monitor if a
person is wearing a face mask. Without manual
supervision, the CNN model could be used to check the
face mask of the people entering enclosed public
spaces. In this project, we build a Convolutional Neural
Network model using TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect,
if a person is wearing a face mask to protect themselves.
At the entrance of these public spaces, a monitor scans
the faces of the people entering and detects if they are
wearing a facemask using the CNN deep learning model.
We collect data from images and pre-process them to
develop a CNN model. This deep-learning algorithm
could be coordinated with the entrance doors of public
places to ensure, no person without a face mask enters
the space.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project model
consists of two categories, i.e., with mask and without
mask. This dataset from Kaggle has over 7000 images
from both categories.

## Results

The covid-19 pandemic has made the face mask a
preventive measure against the disease. This project
model determines if a person is wearing a mask or
not. This model is quite useful for enclosed public
spaces like airports, shopping malls, hospitals, etc.
The model only allows people who are wearing a
mask inside the public space. Many doctors and
scientists have mentioned that even in the post-covid
world, face masks are necessary in public spaces.
